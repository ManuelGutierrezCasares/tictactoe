# Tictactoe Solver

This project was made to start working with PyAutoGUI, which programmatically control the mouse & keyboard.

Requirements to execution (only works in Windows):

1) Installed Google Chrome and pinned to Task Bar
2) Open this URL as a new tab and leave it there https://poki.com/es/g/tictactoe
3) Execute main.py

Disclaimer: every step of this program is hardcoded and the only goal of this project is to understand and test how PyAutoGUI works, both its control over mouse and keyboard, as well as the recognition of logos on the screen. 

Made out of curiosity, focused on future use.
